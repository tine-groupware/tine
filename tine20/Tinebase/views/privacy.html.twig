{{ app.branding.title }} takes privacy seriously.  According to our key principles of
openness, freedom, transparency and quality, privacy is in fact a core
component and motivation behind the {{ app.branding.title }} software.

In Contrast to many other web services where using the software is paid
by the disposal of personal information and the abundance of privacy the
{{ app.branding.title }} open source software gives back freedom and privacy to its
users.

In the following privacy policy we explain how {{ app.branding.title }} may impact its
users privacy and discuss topics to consider from administrative side to
ensure and enhance the users privacy.


SECTION I: DATA STORAGE

(a) Related Software Products
{{ app.branding.title }} is a software which runs in conjunction with various related
software products such as Web-Servers, Database-Servers, Directory-
Servers, SMTP- and IMAP-Servers and others.  All these related software
products may store personal and sensitive data which could impact the
privacy of {{ app.branding.title }} users in various ways. In first place the logfiles
of these related software products must be considered, as they may
contain personal or confidential data. For further impacts on the users
privacy the user manuals of the related software products have to be
consulted.

(b) Database
{{ app.branding.title }} stores almost any information in the configured databases.
These databases contain personal and confidential data. As such these
databases are to be protected against any form of unauthorized access.
More details about securing the database can be found in the vendors
users manual.

(c) Session Files
{{ app.branding.title }} stores personal information about the user (username,
fullname, connection IP-Address etc.) in the users session file of the
web-server. These session files have to be protected against any form of
unauthorized access. In the {{ app.branding.title }} setup process the path where this
session files are saved can be configured.

(d) Caches
{{ app.branding.title }} maintains caches to improve the performance of the software.
These caches may contain sensitive or personal data.  Therefore the
caches have to be protected against unauthorized access in any form. In
the {{ app.branding.title }} setup process the path where cache files are saved can be
configured.

(e) Logfiles
{{ app.branding.title }} is capable to write logfiles containing information of
operation in different levels. Depending on the level this information
may contain sensitive or personal data.  This is particularly the case
for the log levels DEBUG and INFO.  Therefore the logfiles have to be
protected against unauthorized access in any form.  In the {{ app.branding.title }}
setup process the path where logfiles are saved and the log level can be
configured.

(f) Error Messages
If {{ app.branding.title }} detects an exceptional state of the software, informations
about the exceptional state are reported in the logfiles and to the
user. This information contain a so called 'stack trace' of the point
where the exceptional state got detected. This stack traces are
extremely useful to track the source of the exceptional state, e.g. bugs
or misconfigurations of the system, but also may contain sensitive or
personal data of the current user.  To suppress the stack traces in the
error messages the configuration 'suppressExceptionTraces' can be set in
the installations config.inc.php.

(g) User Client Session Data
The {{ app.branding.title }} client software is a javascript software which runs in the
browser of the user. During a users session, this client holds various
caches and local stores of data objects which may contain personal or
sensitive data. Therefore the computer system the client software runs
on is to be protected against unauthorized access in any form.
Destruction of these client side data should take place at quitting time
of the user agent. Details of this destruction process are subject of
the particular privacy policies of the clients user agent.


SECTION II: DATA TRANSFER WITH VENDORS SERVICES

about the exceptional state are reported to the user containing a "Bug
Reporting Form". In this form the user can add a description of what he
did when the error occurred and moreover add contact information for
further inquiries. Submissions of this form are send as 'Bug Reports' to
the software vendor and are extremely useful to find bugs and exception
sources within the software. The permission to send Bug Reports can be
set as a 'Role Right' in the {{ app.branding.title }} Role Administration module.
Additionally to the description and optional contact information, these
Bug Reports contain the version of the {{ app.branding.title }} installation and, if
configured, the stack trace of the exceptional state as well as
informations about the request and response of the transaction which
lead to the exceptional state. Due to the nature of data transmission,
the referrer, user agent and IP address of the user are included in the
submission.

To consequently improve the usability of the {{ app.branding.title }} the software
vendor offers user surveys where users directly can give feedback and
help to improve the software to their own needs. To check if a new
survey for participation is available a request to a foreign website has
to be made. To suppress this request, the configuration 'denySurveys'
