## quick start
tine consists of a number of integrated services which are provided as oci images. The easiest way to get you own
evaluation copy up and running on premise, please follow our [quick-start-guide](https://tine-docu.s3web.rz1.metaways.net/en/operators/Installation_Guide/#quickstart).

For most use cases our [saas packages](https://www.tine-groupware.de/produkte/) should be the perfect fit to get a
professional hosting environment.

On Premise options are available also but should be evaluated carefully as running tine performant, secure and high
available is not an easy task and usually pays of for large installations or restricted environments only.

## support
**Please note:** All our [packages](https://www.tine-groupware.de/produkte/) include support options and a separate
issue tracking system. Issue tracking here is for our developers' community only.

In general, users of the developers' community are technically experienced and able to help themselves. The ability to read,
understand and change the software as well as to share the new version with others really is the heart of free software.

Having said this, in our [issues](https://github.com/tine-groupware/tine/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/tine-groupware/discussions) sections
you can get support from other developers' community members. As a rule of thumb: You can expect more support from others the more
you contribute yourself. Don't expect others to contribute if you are not willing to contribute yourself. Remember: We
are a developers' community of free software enthusiasts and innovators. If you are out for a good Samaritan you need to look
elsewhere.

There is no commercial support for the developers' community versions at all. Please be fair and don't try to suck community
resources if you are not willing or able to contribute to the community.

## documentation & training
A nightly version of our documentation is published to https://tine-docu.s3web.rz1.metaways.net.

As tine is extremely powerful, feature rich and customizable we emphasize to train your operators, admins and users properly.
Introducing tine in your organisation is a project itself.
