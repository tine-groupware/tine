# License Expiry

## Active License Expiry Information

The expiry info becomes visible in the upper right hand corner, if

- there are less than 90 days left until the license expires
- your user has the role right "show_license_info" (the default Admin group has it)
- it is shown in red, if you got only 14 days left

## My License Expired - What happens?

- Only the oldest (by creation time) 5 users can log in
- All other users can't log in and you get an error message in the log
- License features (like preview-creation) are disabled
