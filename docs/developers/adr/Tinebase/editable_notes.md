## Context

User would like to edit notes.

## Decision

We won't do that atm because the notes feature is currently not where we want it to be.

- notes won't show up in the grid
- notes don't have acl (for example it should be possible to add notes for records on which the user does not have write grant)
- textareas can be used for notes

## Consequences

Documentation was updated to reflect the current state. We should improve the whole notes feature at some point.
