# Welcome to tine docs

As of version "Ellie" 2023.11, tine Groupware documentation is centralised here.
We encourage everyone to improve this documentation by creating simple merge-requests in our
[github repo](https://github.com/tine-groupware/tine).

This documentation is based on the beautiful [mkdocs.org](https://www.mkdocs.org) system. You can find the full documentation 
how to use and write docs there. Our workflows and adoptions can be found [here.](developers/mkdocs)

# Layout

tine Groupware is a large system and there are multiple different roles/personas looking for help and documentation.
Therefore, we created the following entry points:

## [Users - End Users](./users/)
End users who are just using the software using their browsers. 

## [Admins - Professional Administration](./admins/)
Professional administrators who have the right to run the admin application and some of its modules.

## [Operators - Technical Administration](./operators/)
Technical administrators who have root access to the server systems tine groupware runs on. 

## [Developers](./developers/)
Developers, Translators and other fearless people creating tine Groupware.
