### Commit Message Guidelines

Tine 2.0 uses [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) style commit messages:
 
    <type>(<scope>): MESSAGE
    
    [optional body]
    
    [optional footer]

Example:

    feature(Addressbook): adds type-ahead to some contact fields
    
    * company
    * unit
    * address data
    
    closes #289

Another:
    
    fix(Phone): improve handling of empty phone numbers

    ... when looking for the matching contact

See also the [AngularJS commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

<type> can be one of the following:

- tweak
- hack
- fix
- feature
- build
- docs
- perf
- refactor
- style
- test
- config
- script
- text

Some example <scope>s:

- APPNAME like Addressbook, Calendar, Tasks
- Tests / Unittests
- Cli
- Import, Export
- Setup

You should reference a GitHub issue (if exists) like this:

    See #1234
    
If the commit closes an issue, it should be done like this:

    Closes #1234
    
(or any other "closing" keyword - see https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/ for reference)

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of the reverted commit.
In the body it should say: "This reverts commit <hash>", where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

We also use some annotations to mark commits for documentation follow-ups:

- @usermanual (User manual needs to be updated because of this commit)
- @releasenotes (RELEASENOTES need to be updated because of this commit)

## Reporting Bugs

Before submitting an issue please check that you’ve completed the following steps:

* Made sure you’re on the latest version
* Used the search feature to ensure that the bug hasn’t been reported before

Bug reports should contain the following information:

* Summary: A brief description
* Steps to reproduce: How did you encounter the bug? Instructions to reproduce it
* Expected behavior: How did you expect it to behave?
* Actual behavior: How did it actually behave?
* References: Links to any related tickets or information sources.
